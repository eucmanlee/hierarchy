Base learning simulation of real world hierarchy
The result would show the transitent performance of organizational learnig.

The result shows that new code generates consistent results. 
But an issue of 'S' parameter is found in this large real work hierarchy.
The final steady state performance always reaches to 100 (i.e. max performance) regardless of the experiment parameters. 
So, I have added two additional scenarios where the Ss are doubled (from 4 to 8).
I expect that this will make premature saturation of knowledge therefore, lowers the steady state performance.

I may need to think about a right wording about the cause that the system
stops learning before it reaches to the perfect knowledge state. 

The important result out of these experimentation is that 
the relative impact of top down intervention increases with the non-linear parameter S.
When the value of S = 1, it is likely that the performances of organizations with and without
top down intervention is marginal relatively to their final period performance. 

However, as the value of S increases to 4 and 8, the performance difference increases in both relative and 
absolute terms. 

This shows that managerial intervention become more valueable and important when the 
given problem - or the level of envirionmental complexity increases. 

As mentioned in the manuscript this may be attributed to the role of managemnet who 
resolves an issue of learning myopia where individuals in large organizations tend to 
fail to see the big picture. The top down intervention, even though those managers
has no knowledge endowment, would facilitate the flow of knowledge which cannot be done
perfectly through bottom up learning process.
