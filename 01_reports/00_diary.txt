Title: reverse percolation test

This project will use the test scenarios in 
Albert, Réka, Hawoong Jeong, and Albert-László Barabási. "Error and attack tolerance of complex networks." nature 406.6794 (2000): 378-382.

on the hierarchical network data. The regular node or link removal process expected to highlight the value and role of vertical bridges in the multi-level structure.
Also, I believe that it is equally interesting to demonstrate that hierarchical network is robust the exogeneous shocks.

The test will start by replicating the prior works. The difference among random, scale-free and hierarchical network will be discussed.

Real network scenarios are tested and results are confirmed. 
It took more than 10 hrs to carry out one hundred trials. 

The impact of top down intervention has been replicated in the real network as well.
But more exhaustive search with additional setting on the complexity factor
S needs to be tested.

Ran another round of hierarchical with real world reporting structure. 
Still, the issue is the performance of this simulation which mostly takes longer than
10 hrs min. Perhaps, I need to find a way to reduce overall read time.

Secondly, It is found that there are missing hierarchy simulation code written in 'R'
It is about the relationship between the size and the average path length.
I may need to check the gdrive. 

Back up of programing code:
Git appears to be highly sophisticated and rigorous. But, it may take some time
to get use to it. 

Issue about an tansient performance:
- previously, it has been found a regular patterns of organizational learing performance across different levels within a hierarchy.
However, once I alter the non-linear factor of S, i.e. S = 1, it appears that the strong correlation between levels and transitent performance is on average is weaken.

'Scaling law' of hierarchic network should be revised or reviewed.
- The prior test document (result) is missing. Shit...managing documents...painful.
- The original 'R' code would be located somewhere in the google drive. - check it out.
